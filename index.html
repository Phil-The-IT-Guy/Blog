          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
        

        <p> Hi! My name is Philip. You will come to know me as Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. This blog is way overdue! Here, I can gallivant, inhabit, and run amuck in my own little universe that I now get to share with you. I have been saying over and over again that I would start this project where I introduce myself to the world and introduce everyone to the world through my eyes. This is my version of a hostile takeover - stealing your attention for moments of bliss when I fly across your screens. </p>

        <p> The world has given me a million reasons to blog! I mean from sharing my life to starting a public journal to strengthening my creative writing skills as I embark on this journey to becoming a self-published author. I am no stranger to writing. I’ve written stories, research, poetry, technical documentation, songs, work papers, and much much more throughout my life, but I don’t think I’ve shared it on a public platform and it’s time to change that. I’m more passionate about writing than most jobs I’ve ever held. In fact, throughout my career, writing has been one of my greatest strengths and serves as a through line of pretty much every single role I’ve had. </p>

        <p> Speaking of my through lines, I have a few. You know about one - I’m a professional writer and communicator. Writing is a muscle that I have been developing since I was a young kid in South Louisiana. My parents always stressed the importance of education so as far as school was concerned I’ve been super dialed in - from the early days of Reading with my kindergarten teachers, Ms. Benoit and Ms Jones, to Professional Communication with Professor Karam to yesterday when my manager affectionately know as Sarge assigned me documentation to write. Writing is a lot like riding a bike - if you stick with it, you never forget. It never leaves you. I chose to stick with writing because it’s one of my favorite forms of self expression and it complements one of my other through lines - life long learning. </p>

        <p> I have held tightly to the charge my parents set out for me on education. Since they spoke those words into my life, I have graduated high school in the top 5% of my class, graduated college twice with a BS in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and an MBA, and I’m flirting with the idea of getting my doctorate. Actually, let’s be clear, I’m not flirting with the idea. It’s a part of my 10 year plan. And before you go getting all judgy on me, you have to understand, I’m not a planner. I’m just a goal oriented guy, which brings me to my third and final through line. </p>

        <p> I am the crafter, designer, and creative director of my own experience, no matter what happens. This through line has made me into the man I am. I bolster traits of determination, integrity, perseverance, and  
resilience. I have many of those stories and experiences to share and this is the perfect platform. </p>

        <p> I’m so happy to welcome you all with open arms to the beautiful chaos that is my life. I hope you can find something that makes you laugh, cry, and smile as we navigate our journeys. Thank you for being here with me. :)</p>

          <h3>Blog Post #00 <small>12/23/2025</small></h3>
          
          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
     <p>Hi! It’s Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. Welcome back to my blog and thank you for being here and diving into life with me. On our last installment of Phil The IT Guy, I shared bits and pieces of my why, a short introduction, and some of the key things that make me who I am. 

</p>
     <p>Today we can dive into why I’m starting this blog. There are a million reasons  *you’re giving me a million reasons * but let’s get into them.  For starters, I have always loved writing, so I am using this as a creative outlet and form of self expression. I won’t be perfect and polished like I want to be, but I’ll be my fullest self to which I owe myself. We all owe to ourselves space to be who we are and exist in that happiness. </p>

<p>This has also been a dream of mine - being a writer I mean. I have avoided it for years because I have always wanted to “set myself up for success.” What I actually mean by that is I’ve chased traditional forms of success, but in the past few years, I have evolved and continued to expand on my definition of success. That lifelong learning thing has never escaped me. </p>

<p>Therefore on top of this being an artistic endeavor, this is also about career expansion and professional development for me. My career has been super fucking cool. If you’ve seen The Incredibles, there’s the kid on the tricycle and he goes that was totally wicked. That is how I feel about my career. I sit back in amazement at the things that I’ve done, the skills I’ve honed, and looking at my career through my lens. I started off pretty humbly working in fast food at a Wendy’s. Shoutout to Ms. Deanna. She gave me my first job outside of my little business venture of selling baked goods and plate lunches to raise money to participate in my extracurricular activities. I had an entrepreneurial mindset as a teenager. I never knew how far I could push myself. To this day, I still haven’t been able to quite make out what my limits are. I still feel like I can do anything.</p>

<p> While in college I held a few different jobs, sometimes, juggling a few jobs at once. I work at   a cell center where I would work to get donations from LSU alumni. I kept my Wendy’s job and would go home to work on the weekends during my first spring semester. I became a peer mentor for the LSU Summer Scholars Program - a summer program that I would work with for two summers and also take on an Office Assistant position with. I worked in Operations at the Knock Knock Children Museum for three years; those were some of the best years of my life. I worked at LSU for over two years in IT while getting my masters in business administration. I worked at Ernst and Young - EY for a little over a year. I became an entrepreneur during that time taking on a Real Estate Asset Management role while renting out my house. I picked up a retail job at Target that I still work at mostly just weekends these days, but I honestly love it. I’m an IT Internal Controls Analyst at PACCAR. I picked up the contract role put my degrees and skills to use. My contract ends at the end of the year and it’s been a journey, but I’m glad I landed there. That leads me right into this - now I’m a blogger/content creator/creative writer. </p> 

<p>I see this as another rung on my career ladder. Launching my brand as a self-published author, blogger/content creator, and podcaster feels right; it feels like I’m building a little media conglomerate. It’s exhilarating, interesting, and different, but most importantly it’s all me and that feels great. </p>

<p>I used to think “I want something substantial.” I did it for two years and I loved it truly, but I knew I could do more. I went the corporate route and  it has been an era, but not my end all, be all. I think this - where I’m heading - is where I’m meant to be.</p>

          <p></p>
 <p> I’m so dead! Hello everyone! </p>
 <p> Hi! It’s Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. Welcome back to my blog. Thank you for coming back to experience more moments with me. Today’s blogpost is dedicated to where my career planning started. Let’s dive into the makings of me - Phil The It Guy. </p>
 <p> I think I took about 5 years to fully workshop my 5 -year plan before I put it into motion. Since my senior year of high school, I had been trying to plan what my first 5 years outside of the comfort of college would be. I used to think it would consist of 5-10 more years of schooling for physiatry or psychiatry. I know, both very specific, but I was serious. The mind body connection is a very interesting topic to me. If I had been just a little more dedicated, I probably would have stuck with it, but I followed my second plan - I went the business route. </p>
 <p> I was inspired by Ms. Monique. We had had countless conversations and I remember playing with her children when I worked at the children’s museum. Monique worked in IT and she explained themes of daily problem solving and never knowing what each day would hold. I resonated with those themes and wanted something of the sorts for my career. </p>
 <p> Changing my major had never been a part of my plan, but it was a stepping stone to getting where I needed to go. I graduated in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and secured my first job out of college as an IT Analyst. That was actually the beginning of my 5 year plan. I made about 8 goals spread across the different facets of my life including professional, personal, and spiritual growth. My professional goals were to find a job before graduating, get my masters degree, and become a cloud consultant. My personal goals were to buy a house and buy a vehicle. My spiritual goals were to build a healthier version of myself and continue making my inner child happy by chasing my dreams/potential. </p>
 <p> As if that weren’t a tall enough order, I committed to completing my 5-year plan. I graduated from college in May 2021 marking the start of my plan. By the start of my plan, I had already completed one of the goals. I wanted to secure a job before i graduated. In addition to that goal, I slowly rolled out other goals one after the other. By the end of the summer, I bought a house. How did I buy a house at 22 with little income? That’s a story for a different day, but just know I was and will always be an industrious young man. </p>
<p> In fact, I would continue to crush my goals one by one. I applied to graduate school within the year of graduating and took on an 11 month graduate masters in business program. My truck was pretty old but it was still kicking. While there was life in Mini - the affectionate nickname my mom had given to it, I rode Mini until the wheels feel off. I even put new wheels on Mini and rode Mini until I had to give it up. I took some money I had saved up and bought a new truck. After entering my masters program, I began recruitment for a position to take my career to the next level after college. You’ll never guess what kind of role I achieved -  cloud consultant. Well to be exact, it was a Technology Risk Consultant position, but I mean my first client was Amazon - a Financial Audit IT Audit specialist under the tech risk consultant position and certified in AWS - a cloud consultant I was. </p> 
<p> All of these things were happening so fast, but by 2.5 years I had fully completed my 5 year plan. I moved for my new role shaking a significant shift in my life. With this shift, I tried new things including going to the gym all throughout the week, a pescatarian diet, and living the corporate life. It was truly growth to become who I was always meant to be - a go-getting, happier, healthier version of me - Phil The It Guy. </p>
<p> Signing off,</p>
<p>Phil </p>
