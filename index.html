<h3>Feature Blog Post: Phil the Stability Guy <small>1/20/2026</small></h3>

<p>Hi! It’s Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the ITverse. Welcome back to my blog. Today’s blog features one of my favorite stories of my career. The story follows my tenure at EY and well every role I’ve been in actually.
Today’s focus will be talking about the first time I knew I was where I needed to be at EY. </p>

<p> While working at EY, I consulted on some of the best teams at 3 Fortune 500 companies including 2 clients within the top ten. During this busy season, one of my teammates was scheduled part-time on our client engagement and another client engagement. Due to this unexpected change, I took on the opportunity to step up and help remove some of the work, which was huge for me. I am truly a background support/silent partner when it comes to team dynamics. I always want to have a presence and support team needs, but I never want to overwhelm myself because that would be detrimental to my team’s success. I like frame myself as a remover of impediments. </p>

<p> In taking on this responsibility, I coordinated with my teammate and senior team members by getting notes and deciding a plan to get things done smoothly. I took the notes and checked the prior year understanding with the new year understanding. I was able to get about 75% of those notes loaded, distributed, and progressed through first- and second-level review. I communicated any concerns and leftover material to my seniors and my colleague and I divided and conquered any remaining documentation. Amongst my own work, I had managed to squeeze in extra work and more meetings. This experience reinforced my ability to balance primary responsibilities while absorbing additional audit workload without impacting quality or deadlines. </p>

<p> It was a textbook example and shining moment of how one can show up for your team. I shifted the energy in the room even with a little pressure on myself. Being under pressure is very in my nature though. I like to execute, plan, and strategize success in moments like these. I handled all of the planning with our offshore team. I executed on verifying the notes and documentation as well as closing any gaps in knowledge with my senior. I strategized how I could get more documentation to the next level for review. All in all, I boosted an addition 15% of documentation through review outside of my normal expectations. </p>

<p> During a one on one meeting with my Senior Manager, she expressed just how well I had been performing. She thanked me for showing lots of progress as that was unusual of new consultants. She also respected the way I had managed that aspect of our project. At this time, she had already awarded me two Bravo Awards for my progress in ramping up for the busy season and again for stepping up and handling a significant portion of the work during the time. I received three bravo awards from her and I felt accomplished for those, but even outside of those, I was watching the well oiled machine work. Seeing how my puzzle piece fit into the big picture confirmed to me that I was where I needed to be. Thanks to this experience, I show up on audit teams today as a stabilizing presence — steady, prepared, and focused on keeping the machine moving. </p>

          <h3>Feature Blog Post: Phil the Workflow Management Guy<small>1/13/2026</small></h3>

          
     

 <p> Hi! It’s Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the ITverse. Welcome back to my blog. Today’s blog features workflow management and solution delivery and design within Microsoft’s Power Automate. This solution requires multiple steps but today’s focus will be designing the workflow based on the prompt and delivering the solution. </p>

 <p> During my tenure, I worked under an IT division for a client. One of their stakeholders previously had a workflow that integrated SharePoint, Outlook, and Power Automate to communicate updates about important deliverables. Due to a lack of expertise, there were no controls set for when the SME over this process took leave. This resulted in a control gap within their IT process. The prompt was to integrate the systems as before with a list of key components, test the integration, and deliver the solution with a solid implementation addressing the control gaps. </p>

 <p> For the sake of transparency, here are the list of key components, an integration testing matrix, and the control gaps. </p>

 <p> Key Components: </p>
 <p> - Variables: Status, Due Date </p>
 <p> - Conditions: Submission Status = Submitted, Status = Active, Due  <p> Dates = Outputs </p>
  <p> - Data Ops: Ticks, Due Date in Ticks, Difference in Days in Ticks </p>
  <p> - Stakeholders: Preparer, Manager, Controller </p>

 <p> Integration Testing Matrix </p>
  <p> - Test for Confirming Variables: confirm they work </p>
  <p> - Test Messaging for Due Date Variation: receive message for all messaging </p>
  <p> - Test Conditions (according to SharePoint) </p>
  <p> - Test Stakeholders Reminder Workflow </p>
  <p> - Unit testing: top count check and check for looping </p>

 <p> Control Gaps </p>
 <p> - Resulted in deficiency as workflow stopped </p>
 <p> - No reminders sent out </p>
 <p> - Lack of continuity </p>
 <p> - Management lacked documentation/access to workflows </p>

 <p> For context, let’s walkthrough the importance of these items. The key components served as scope, scale, and quantitative/qualitative structure over this project. The variables anchor the communications by specifying a centralized due date and a status to manage the workflow around. Within the conditions, the statuses narrow the scope of each unit so only the important units are being measured and communicated. The other portion of the condition, the outputs, are quantifiable thresholds that determine when each stakeholder receives their update. The Data Ops portion which includes the compose functions are doing the computations in the form of ticks. Ticks are a form of measurement that counts date and timestamps using digits as the value. The stakeholders are a tiered list of user profiles who will receive communications about deliverables depending on their set threshold. </p>

 <p> These items were arranged into a workflow where the variables are initialized, data is ingested from the SharePoint site, and the computations take place. That sets the stage for the data to flow and be used downstream by the conditional statements narrowing the scope and then the action of sending communications about each deliverable based on the stakeholders set within the SharePoint site. Through the integration testing matrix, lots of information was learned about the limitations of the systems in use as well as some of the methods that were originally used, but more on that later. The most important outcome is that using this matrix the solution was stress tested and delivered on the needs of management. While that did the heavy lifting on management’s side, there were some other factors that needed handling that I addressed. </p>

 <p> Since management had no idea where the documentation was, I created two pieces of documentation - one to document the process from design through cutover and another document to teach management to build this workflow from scratch. In addition to that, I shared the planning workflow with both management and the SME once they returned, further resolving their continuity issue. To add the cherry on top, I initiated the creation, documentation, and implementation of a service account to house the final version of the project. All of these steps were taken on management’s behalf to address all control gaps presented when the SME went on leave. </p>

<p> The final solution restored continuity to the formerly deficient control bringing it to remediation. It resulted in automated reminders to stakeholders as well as removal of single-SME dependency. </p>

          <h3>Blog Post #0 <small>12/16/2025</small></h3>
          
          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
        

        <p> Hi! My name is Philip. You will come to know me as Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. This blog is way overdue! Here, I can gallivant, inhabit, and run amuck in my own little universe that I now get to share with you. I have been saying over and over again that I would start this project where I introduce myself to the world and introduce everyone to the world through my eyes. This is my version of a hostile takeover - stealing your attention for moments of bliss when I fly across your screens. </p>

        <p> The world has given me a million reasons to blog! I mean from sharing my life to starting a public journal to strengthening my creative writing skills as I embark on this journey to becoming a self-published author. I am no stranger to writing. I’ve written stories, research, poetry, technical documentation, songs, work papers, and much much more throughout my life, but I don’t think I’ve shared it on a public platform and it’s time to change that. I’m more passionate about writing than most jobs I’ve ever held. In fact, throughout my career, writing has been one of my greatest strengths and serves as a through line of pretty much every single role I’ve had. </p>

        <p> Speaking of my through lines, I have a few. You know about one - I’m a professional writer and communicator. Writing is a muscle that I have been developing since I was a young kid in South Louisiana. My parents always stressed the importance of education so as far as school was concerned I’ve been super dialed in - from the early days of Reading with my kindergarten teachers, Ms. Benoit and Ms Jones, to Professional Communication with Professor Karam to yesterday when my manager affectionately know as Sarge assigned me documentation to write. Writing is a lot like riding a bike - if you stick with it, you never forget. It never leaves you. I chose to stick with writing because it’s one of my favorite forms of self expression and it complements one of my other through lines - life long learning. </p>

        <p> I have held tightly to the charge my parents set out for me on education. Since they spoke those words into my life, I have graduated high school in the top 5% of my class, graduated college twice with a BS in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and an MBA, and I’m flirting with the idea of getting my doctorate. Actually, let’s be clear, I’m not flirting with the idea. It’s a part of my 10 year plan. And before you go getting all judgy on me, you have to understand, I’m not a planner. I’m just a goal oriented guy, which brings me to my third and final through line. </p>

        <p> I am the crafter, designer, and creative director of my own experience, no matter what happens. This through line has made me into the man I am. I bolster traits of determination, integrity, perseverance, and  
resilience. I have many of those stories and experiences to share and this is the perfect platform. </p>

        <p> I’m so happy to welcome you all with open arms to the beautiful chaos that is my life. I hope you can find something that makes you laugh, cry, and smile as we navigate our journeys. Thank you for being here with me. :)</p>

          <h3>Blog Post #00 <small>12/23/2025</small></h3>
          
          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
     <p>Hi! It’s Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. Welcome back to my blog and thank you for being here and diving into life with me. On our last installment of Phil The IT Guy, I shared bits and pieces of my why, a short introduction, and some of the key things that make me who I am. 

</p>
     <p>Today we can dive into why I’m starting this blog. There are a million reasons  *you’re giving me a million reasons * but let’s get into them.  For starters, I have always loved writing, so I am using this as a creative outlet and form of self expression. I won’t be perfect and polished like I want to be, but I’ll be my fullest self to which I owe myself. We all owe to ourselves space to be who we are and exist in that happiness. </p>

<p>This has also been a dream of mine - being a writer I mean. I have avoided it for years because I have always wanted to “set myself up for success.” What I actually mean by that is I’ve chased traditional forms of success, but in the past few years, I have evolved and continued to expand on my definition of success. That lifelong learning thing has never escaped me. </p>

<p>Therefore on top of this being an artistic endeavor, this is also about career expansion and professional development for me. My career has been super fucking cool. If you’ve seen The Incredibles, there’s the kid on the tricycle and he goes that was totally wicked. That is how I feel about my career. I sit back in amazement at the things that I’ve done, the skills I’ve honed, and looking at my career through my lens. I started off pretty humbly working in fast food at a Wendy’s. Shoutout to Ms. Deanna. She gave me my first job outside of my little business venture of selling baked goods and plate lunches to raise money to participate in my extracurricular activities. I had an entrepreneurial mindset as a teenager. I never knew how far I could push myself. To this day, I still haven’t been able to quite make out what my limits are. I still feel like I can do anything.</p>

<p> While in college I held a few different jobs, sometimes, juggling a few jobs at once. I work at   a cell center where I would work to get donations from LSU alumni. I kept my Wendy’s job and would go home to work on the weekends during my first spring semester. I became a peer mentor for the LSU Summer Scholars Program - a summer program that I would work with for two summers and also take on an Office Assistant position with. I worked in Operations at the Knock Knock Children Museum for three years; those were some of the best years of my life. I worked at LSU for over two years in IT while getting my masters in business administration. I worked at Ernst and Young - EY for a little over a year. I became an entrepreneur during that time taking on a Real Estate Asset Management role while renting out my house. I picked up a retail job at Target that I still work at mostly just weekends these days, but I honestly love it. I’m an IT Internal Controls Analyst at PACCAR. I picked up the contract role put my degrees and skills to use. My contract ends at the end of the year and it’s been a journey, but I’m glad I landed there. That leads me right into this - now I’m a blogger/content creator/creative writer. </p> 

<p>I see this as another rung on my career ladder. Launching my brand as a self-published author, blogger/content creator, and podcaster feels right; it feels like I’m building a little media conglomerate. It’s exhilarating, interesting, and different, but most importantly it’s all me and that feels great. </p>

<p>I used to think “I want something substantial.” I did it for two years and I loved it truly, but I knew I could do more. I went the corporate route and  it has been an era, but not my end all, be all. I think this - where I’m heading - is where I’m meant to be.</p>

          <h3>Blogpost #01 <small>12/30/2025</small></h3>
          <p></p>
 <p> I’m so dead! Hello everyone! </p>
 <p> Hi! It’s Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. Welcome back to my blog. Thank you for coming back to experience more moments with me. Today’s blogpost is dedicated to where my career planning started. Let’s dive into the makings of me - Phil The It Guy. </p>
 <p> I think I took about 5 years to fully workshop my 5 -year plan before I put it into motion. Since my senior year of high school, I had been trying to plan what my first 5 years outside of the comfort of college would be. I used to think it would consist of 5-10 more years of schooling for physiatry or psychiatry. I know, both very specific, but I was serious. The mind body connection is a very interesting topic to me. If I had been just a little more dedicated, I probably would have stuck with it, but I followed my second plan - I went the business route. </p>
 <p> I was inspired by Ms. Monique. We had had countless conversations and I remember playing with her children when I worked at the children’s museum. Monique worked in IT and she explained themes of daily problem solving and never knowing what each day would hold. I resonated with those themes and wanted something of the sorts for my career. </p>
 <p> Changing my major had never been a part of my plan, but it was a stepping stone to getting where I needed to go. I graduated in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and secured my first job out of college as an IT Analyst. That was actually the beginning of my 5 year plan. I made about 8 goals spread across the different facets of my life including professional, personal, and spiritual growth. My professional goals were to find a job before graduating, get my masters degree, and become a cloud consultant. My personal goals were to buy a house and buy a vehicle. My spiritual goals were to build a healthier version of myself and continue making my inner child happy by chasing my dreams/potential. </p>
 <p> As if that weren’t a tall enough order, I committed to completing my 5-year plan. I graduated from college in May 2021 marking the start of my plan. By the start of my plan, I had already completed one of the goals. I wanted to secure a job before i graduated. In addition to that goal, I slowly rolled out other goals one after the other. By the end of the summer, I bought a house. How did I buy a house at 22 with little income? That’s a story for a different day, but just know I was and will always be an industrious young man. </p>
<p> In fact, I would continue to crush my goals one by one. I applied to graduate school within the year of graduating and took on an 11 month graduate masters in business program. My truck was pretty old but it was still kicking. While there was life in Mini - the affectionate nickname my mom had given to it, I rode Mini until the wheels feel off. I even put new wheels on Mini and rode Mini until I had to give it up. I took some money I had saved up and bought a new truck. After entering my masters program, I began recruitment for a position to take my career to the next level after college. You’ll never guess what kind of role I achieved -  cloud consultant. Well to be exact, it was a Technology Risk Consultant position, but I mean my first client was Amazon - a Financial Audit IT Audit specialist under the tech risk consultant position and certified in AWS - a cloud consultant I was. </p> 
<p> All of these things were happening so fast, but by 2.5 years I had fully completed my 5 year plan. I moved for my new role shaking a significant shift in my life. With this shift, I tried new things including going to the gym all throughout the week, a pescatarian diet, and living the corporate life. It was truly growth to become who I was always meant to be - a go-getting, happier, healthier version of me - Phil The It Guy. </p>
<p> Signing off,</p>
<p>Phil </p>
