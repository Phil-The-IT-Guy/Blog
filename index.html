          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
        

        <p> Hi! My name is Philip. You will come to know me as Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. This blog is way overdue! Here, I can gallivant, inhabit, and run amuck in my own little universe that I now get to share with you. I have been saying over and over again that I would start this project where I introduce myself to the world and introduce everyone to the world through my eyes. This is my version of a hostile takeover - stealing your attention for moments of bliss when I fly across your screens. </p>

        <p> The world has given me a million reasons to blog! I mean from sharing my life to starting a public journal to strengthening my creative writing skills as I embark on this journey to becoming a self-published author. I am no stranger to writing. I’ve written stories, research, poetry, technical documentation, songs, work papers, and much much more throughout my life, but I don’t think I’ve shared it on a public platform and it’s time to change that. I’m more passionate about writing than most jobs I’ve ever held. In fact, throughout my career, writing has been one of my greatest strengths and serves as a through line of pretty much every single role I’ve had. </p>

        <p> Speaking of my through lines, I have a few. You know about one - I’m a professional writer and communicator. Writing is a muscle that I have been developing since I was a young kid in South Louisiana. My parents always stressed the importance of education so as far as school was concerned I’ve been super dialed in - from the early days of Reading with my kindergarten teachers, Ms. Benoit and Ms Jones, to Professional Communication with Professor Karam to yesterday when my manager affectionately know as Sarge assigned me documentation to write. Writing is a lot like riding a bike - if you stick with it, you never forget. It never leaves you. I chose to stick with writing because it’s one of my favorite forms of self expression and it complements one of my other through lines - life long learning. </p>

        <p> I have held tightly to the charge my parents set out for me on education. Since they spoke those words into my life, I have graduated high school in the top 5% of my class, graduated college twice with a BS in Information Systems and Decision Sciences and an MBA, and I’m flirting with the idea of getting my doctorate. Actually, let’s be clear, I’m not flirting with the idea. It’s a part of my 10 year plan. And before you go getting all judgy on me, you have to understand, I’m not a planner. I’m just a goal oriented guy, which brings me to my third and final through line. </p>

        <p> I am the crafter, designer, and creative director of my own experience, no matter what happens. This through line has made me into the man I am. I bolster traits of determination, integrity, perseverance, and  
resilience. I have many of those stories and experiences to share and this is the perfect platform. </p>

        <p> I’m so happy to welcome you all with open arms to the beautiful chaos that is my life. I hope you can find something that makes you laugh, cry, and smile as we navigate our journeys. Thank you for being here with me. :)</p>

          <h3>Blog Post #00 <small>12/23/2025</small></h3>
          
          <p>I’m so dead! Hello everyone!</p>
     <p>Hi! It’s Phil the It Guy, Phil the IT Guy, the navigator of my corner of the universe. Welcome back to my blog and thank you for being here and diving into life with me. On our last installment of Phil The IT Guy, I shared bits and pieces of my why, a short introduction, and some of the key things that make me who I am. 

</p>
     <p>Today we can dive into why I’m starting this blog. There are a million reasons  *you’re giving me a million reasons * but let’s get into them.  For starters, I have always loved writing, so I am using this as a creative outlet and form of self expression. I won’t be perfect and polished like I want to be, but I’ll be my fullest self to which I owe myself. We all owe to ourselves space to be who we are and exist in that happiness. </p>

<p>This has also been a dream of mine - being a writer I mean. I have avoided it for years because I have always wanted to “set myself up for success.” What I actually mean by that is I’ve chased traditional forms of success, but in the past few years, I have evolved and continued to expand on my definition of success. That lifelong learning thing has never escaped me. </p>

<p>Therefore on top of this being an artistic endeavor, this is also about career expansion and professional development for me. My career has been super fucking cool. If you’ve seen The Incredibles, there’s the kid on the tricycle and he goes that was totally wicked. That is how I feel about my career. I sit back in amazement at the things that I’ve done, the skills I’ve honed, and looking at my career through my lens. I started off pretty humbly working in fast food at a Wendy’s. Shoutout to Ms. Deanna. She gave me my first job outside of my little business venture of selling baked goods and plate lunches to raise money to participate in my extracurricular activities. I had an entrepreneurial mindset as a teenager. I never knew how far I could push myself. To this day, I still haven’t been able to quite make out what my limits are. I still feel like I can do anything.</p>

<p> While in college I held a few different jobs, sometimes, juggling a few jobs at once. I work at   a cell center where I would work to get donations from LSU alumni. I kept my Wendy’s job and would go home to work on the weekends during my first spring semester. I became a peer mentor for the LSU Summer Scholars Program - a summer program that I would work with for two summers and also take on an Office Assistant position with. I worked in Operations at the Knock Knock Children Museum for three years; those were some of the best years of my life. I worked at LSU for over two years in IT while getting my masters in business administration. I worked at Ernst and Young - EY for a little over a year. I became an entrepreneur during that time taking on a Real Estate Asset Management role while renting out my house. I picked up a retail job at Target that I still work at mostly just weekends these days, but I honestly love it. I’m an IT Internal Controls Analyst at PACCAR. I picked up the contract role put my degrees and skills to use. My contract ends at the end of the year and it’s been a journey, but I’m glad I landed there. That leads me right into this - now I’m a blogger/content creator/creative writer. </p> 

<p>I see this as another rung on my career ladder. Launching my brand as a self-published author, blogger/content creator, and podcaster feels right; it feels like I’m building a little media conglomerate. It’s exhilarating, interesting, and different, but most importantly it’s all me and that feels great. </p>

<p>I used to think “I want something substantial.” I did it for two years and I loved it truly, but I knew I could do more. I went the corporate route and  it has been an era, but not my end all, be all. I think this - where I’m heading - is where I’m meant to be.</p>
